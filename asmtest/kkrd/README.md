Assembly Test

David - Kim - Kaitlyn - Rocco

This is an inefficient multiplier that uses an unnecessarily recursive
set up (read: multiplier using a stack). It then subtracts the first
value piece from the second. No non-standard instructions are used.

The end result should be $s7 = 40, $s6 = 360, and $v0 = -320.
