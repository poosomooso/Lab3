## MIPS Assembly Test Program: Slope of a Line ##

This program calculates the slope of a line between two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

It takes four **positive integer** values as parameters and returns an integer value as the **floored** slope.

The default parameters (points 0,0 and 3,6) are loaded into the $a registers.  To change parameters values, modify lines 6-9.  The program should return a slope of 2 to the $t3 register.
This program only includes instructions from the reduced set.
