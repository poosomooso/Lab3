# MIPS Assembly Test - Calculate Square

This test utilizes the ten commands supported by our CPUs while focusing on testing hazards.
It also computes the square of a positive integer.

Expected Output: A positive integer that is the square of the initial value

```
$t0: 1, $t1: 2, $t2: 3, $t3: 5, $t4: 1, $t5: 1, $t6: 4, $t7: 25 
```

All of the instructions used are part of the standard MIPS subset for the lab.
