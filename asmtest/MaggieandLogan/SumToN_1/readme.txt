This assembly program adds all integers from 1 to N. For example, the way this code is set up has N=10, so the result of the program will be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10=55

At the end of the run, the answer 55 will be saved in $t1, and N will be saved in $a0 and $a1. 

The program takes 70 instructions to run; 27 R type and 43 I type.
