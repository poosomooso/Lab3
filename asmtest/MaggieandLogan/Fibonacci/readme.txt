This is a basic fibonacci program to calculate the Nth fibonacci number. 

To execute it, you enter N on line 5 (currently set to 5), assigning it to $a0. 
At the end, you should see your result in $t3. The N-1-th Fibonacci number will be in $t2, for your reference. 
There is also a "done" flag: $v1 will be set to 1 when the program completes. 

For N=5, it will take 37 instrcutions to complete: 17 R type and 20 I type
