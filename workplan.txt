	Expected results of the test
  Any memory layout requirements (e.g. .data section)
  Any instructions used outside the basic required subset (ok to use, but try to submit at least one test program everyone can run)
Report - 1 hour - Done by Thursday 11/16
  Written description and block diagram of your processor architecture. Consider including selected RTL to capture how instructions are implemented.
  Description of your test plan and results
  Some performance/area analysis of your design. This can be for the full processor, or a case study of choices made designing a single unit. It can be based on calculation, simulation, Vivado synthesis results, or a mix of all three.
